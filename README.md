## This is a mirror

I originally found this driver as a ZIP file after going through several layers of dreadful web forms,
giving over personal details etc.

This is an unofficial, unmaintained mirror. The driver code is GPL.

The [initial commit](https://github.com/paulfurley/smart-label-printer-slp-linux-driver/commit/3bfaa74b584414b57dc02cb3835a690f091dac30) should exactly match the contents of that ZIP file.

The original ZIP file checksums below:

- filename: `SLP-600-400-LinuxCUPSDriver_01.zip`
- md5: `d1bef35acc6ca6d4c201a0048c7e6ef4`
